## Simple Minesweeper Project
I started this little project to created a very minesweeper so everyone can play it. I wanted to make it very basic and minimalistic to play.

## How to play 
1. Download the `minesweeper.zip` directory.
2. Open the file and click the `index.html` file.
3. Enjoy the game.
